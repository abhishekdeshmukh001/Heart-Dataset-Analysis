## Title: IRIS Dataset Advanced Visualizations

This repository contains an advanced data visualization project using Python with the IMDB Movie Dataset. The IMDB dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and data analysis, and in this project, I've taken it a step further by implementing advanced visualization techniques to gain deeper insights.

### A. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes related to heart to be examined such as trestbps, chol, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, etc.

We will be using the following dataset:

      heart.csv

### B. Advanced Visualization Techniques:
In this project, I've applied advanced data visualization techniques such as:

      1. Catplot - Grid of count plots, where each subplot represents the distribution of the 'target' variable for different categories of the 'cp' variable
      2. Heatmap that visually represents the correlations between different variables in your dataset, likely related to heart disease.
      3. Pairplot - Generating a grid of scatterplots that are helpful for exploring the relationships, correlations, and distributions between these numerical variables in the dataset.
