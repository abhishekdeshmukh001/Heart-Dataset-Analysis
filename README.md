## Title: Heart Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an advanced data analysis and visualization project using Python with the Heart Dataset. I've taken the project a step further by implementing advanced analysis and visualization techniques to gain deeper insights.

### A. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes related to heart to be examined such as trestbps, chol, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, etc.

We will be using the following dataset:

      heart.csv

### B. Advanced Visualization Techniques:
In this project, I've applied advanced data visualization techniques such as:

      1. Catplot - Grid of count plots, where each subplot represents the distribution of the 'target' variable for different categories of the 'cp' variable
      2. Heatmap that visually represents the correlations between different variables in your dataset, likely related to heart disease.
      3. Pairplot - Generating a grid of scatterplots that are helpful for exploring the relationships, correlations, and distributions between these numerical variables in the dataset.
